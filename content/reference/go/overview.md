`go-ipfs` is the primary reference implementation of IPFS. It is a command-line application, but can also be used as a library in other Go programs.

For more about using the `ipfs` application, see [basic usage](/start/usage) or any of the following reference documents:

- [Configuration reference](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/config.md)
    - [Datastore configuration](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/datastores.md)
    - [Experimental features](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/experimental-features.md)
- [Installing command completion](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/blob/master/docs/command-completion.md)

If you plan to use `go-ipfs` as a package in your own Go application, you can take any of three main approaches:

- Use **[`go-ipfs`](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs)** to run IPFS directly in your own process. See [the API reference](/go/pkg/go-ipfs/core/coreapi).
- Use **[`go-ipfs-api`](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs-api)** to communicate with an IPFS daemon in a separate process via its HTTP API (this is what `go-ipfs` does if a daemon is already running). See [the API reference](/go/pkg/go-ipfs-api).
- Use other Go packages to communicate with the HTTP API directly. See the [HTTP API reference](/api/http).
